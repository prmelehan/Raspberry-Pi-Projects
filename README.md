# Raspberry-Pi-Projects

This Repository contains material useful for the Raspberrry Pi.

Some features do not work unless external components are installed. Those components will be listed along with the software needed. The files will be included with the same name as the code file.

For example, senses.py has an instruction booklet named senses.txt.

All software needed within these files are either included with the Raspberry Pi or can easily be downloaded with "apt-get" in a Raspbian Terminal.
